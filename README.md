# FlappyBird.AI
This repository contains both QLearning (numpy) and Deep QLearning (keras) models that learn to play the popular mobile game FlappyBird.

The repo is broken up by the different models. With the model code being mostly contained in `model.py`, a class used to inject the model into `flappy.py`.
